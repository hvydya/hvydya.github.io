A few lessons I learnt while working as a developer. Time and time again these are reminded to me due to various circumstances. I thought I'll write them down so that it can be good for reflection. These are not revolutionary or new in any sense. These are common things that have been written, documented and explained better than I can ever hope to. But when life tries to give you nudges or hints as to how you can make it better you ought to take it seriously. This is my way of taking it seriously.

- What can go wrong will go wrong (eventually at least).
- Design for posterity and Code for delivery.
- Self healing systems are a god send. If you have the time/skill/chance to develop one, do yourself (and your peers) a favor and do it!
- The good ol' "Keep it simple stupid!".
- Eliminate manual interventions. Automate Automate Automate.
